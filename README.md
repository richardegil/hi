# Simple Portfolio site

This is a basic single page portfolio site I built for myself. You can see what it looks like at https://hi.richardegil.com/.

This was built for personal use. Feel free to fork the repo if you think it will help you out. 

Note: 
There is an easter egg in the hero section of the site... you probably want to remove that üòÅ

## Usage

This uses Vite JS for a bundler, and GSAP for some simple scroll based animations.

To install as is: 

```sh
npm install
```

To spin up locally
```sh
npm run dev
```

To build
```sh
npm run build
```
